## Installation
This is a legacy branch using .NET 9.0 for best-effort compatibility with Windows 10 (21H1 or later).  
As Apple Music now requires Windows 11, no official support will be provided for this branch.  

The main development branch can be found [here](https://github.com/PKBeam/AMWin-RP/tree/master).
